const race = '100m Dash';
const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];

// sometimes when building an application we don't have
// the data in the format we want, ideally we would want
// `winners` to be an object rather than an array
// like this:
// {
//   name: 'clint fisher',
//   place: 1,
//   race: race
// }

// here you'll notice we get a syntax error,
// the curly braces we have after the fat arrow
// written like this are interpreted as a function
// block rather than an object literal like we want
// const win = winners.map((winner, i) => {
//   name: winner, 
//   race: race,
//   place: i
//   });
// so we need to wrap those curly braces in parens:
// also note since `i` index is 0 based we will need to
// add 1 so our place positions are correct
// const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({
//   name: winner, 
//   race: race,
//   place: i + 1,
//   })
// );
// also in es6, when a property name matches a property value
// you dont have to repeat it, so we can shorten race:

// this is officially an implicit return with an object literal:
const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({
  name: winner, 
  race,
  place: i + 1,
  })
);

console.table(win);

// const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

// we want to filter this list for people who are older
// than 60 years old
const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];

// rather than using a conditional if statement
// for our age check we can use it in the implicit
// return, any that are over 60 will be returned true
// and added to a new array in `old`
const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
console.log(old);




// const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];

// const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
// console.log(old);
